Android Screen Density Calculator
=================================

Simple webapp to calculate the different measures to make assets on Android.

**Where:** You can [use it here](calculator.html).

**How:** Just change the number on any of the inputs to reflect the value.

**Why:** I often need to calculate different measures to make assets for Android apps and I always end doing the math myself.

**Inspiration:** I used [Skinkers calculator](http://www.skinkers.com/2011/04/08/android-density-pixel-dp-pixel-px-calculator/) but it was outdated. The teehan+lax [Pixel Density Converter](http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/density/) is a nice tool but it doesn't cover the numbers I need.
